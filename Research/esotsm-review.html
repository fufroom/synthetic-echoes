    I think it's a great movie, and of course, art is subjective in general. But it's not entirely the case here. I've seen many people talking about some time loop, that Clem and Joel are going to repeat the cycle, erase each other all over again, etc.
  </p><p>
    And I don't understand where this thing with cycle and time loop is coming from. I mean, I watched the movie, and there's this very particular storyline where Mary (Kirsten Dunst), who is at the beginning of the movie is charmed by the idea of erasing memory. But then we find out that she's in love with her boss, Dr. Mierzwiak. And pretty fast she finds out the truth that they've already had an affair and that she agreed to erase her memory.
  </p><p>
    Maybe this thing with the time loop is coming from here, but here comes the important thing. Mary was charmed with the idea of erasing memory at first, but now she's disgusted by it.
  </p><p>
    She quits the company. And remember how Dr. Mierzwiak mentioned that all information is strictly confidential there?
  </p><p>
    She sends all the personal tapes to the people who erased their memories, telling them how wrong erasing memory is. Imagine how big of a scandal this could cause once it goes public. How many lawsuits this erasing company will have to face? I doubt they will be able to continue this business.
  </p><p>
    But even if they will, who said that Joel and Clem are going to erase each other again?
  </p><p>
    It is said many times that Clem is impulsive and that it was basically an impulsive decision. Clem was scammed by Patrick (Elijah Wood) right after that. Although she couldn't tell for sure, she felt that something was wrong, she felt confused.
  </p><p>
    I think after all this, she will think twice before even thinking of erasing her memory. It wasn't a pleasant experience for her at all.
  </p><p>
    The most important thing people forget, it's that it was Joel who tried to make amends to her and fix their relationship before he found out that she erased him. If Clem wouldn't erase Joel, MAYBE they would be fine, who knows. I'm sure some of you know a couple that fights a lot and threatens to divorce each other for years, but in the end, they love each other more than anyone can imagine.
  </p><p>
    The whole movie basically screams at you that erasing memory is wrong and that you should appreciate the things you have. From creepy Elijah Wood to Mary's decision in the end. And the way Joel for the whole movie tries to cancel the erasion process because he understands that it's wrong. Why would the creators of the movie imply another cycle of erasion, what's the point?
  </p><p>
    The meaning of the ending scene and final "Okay", is that they will have their struggles. They will have fights, no doubt about that. But they will try to work it through, and they will love and enjoy the time with each other.
  </p><p>
    Maybe they'll succeed. Maybe they'll fail. Maybe they'll break up eventually. Maybe they'll reunite together like Rachel and Ross in Friends. The point is, no one really knows what's going to happen next between them.
  </p><p>
    But the meaning of the film is that real love is worth trying, and it's worth the risk of failing.
  </p><p>
    As <a rpl="" class=" a cursor-pointer
  
  
  
  
  hover:underline
  " href="/user/AjaniReign/">u/AjaniReign</a> pointed out in YouTube comments, in the final scene "For the first time he actually fights for her refusing to let her stop him from loving her. And for the first time in their relationship she actually waits and listens." So, there's a hope.
  </p><p>
    In a sense, this movie reminds me of another movie - Marriage Story (2019). It's both stories about people who sincerely love each other, but can't find a good way to solve their issues. The main plot device there was divorce with lawyers and things, and the main plot device here is the company erasing memories.
  </p><p>
    UPD: Okay, I've got to briefly update this. <a rpl="" class=" a cursor-pointer
  
  
  
  
  hover:underline
  " href="/user/Shelly_895/">u/Shelly_895</a> told me that in the initial script, there really was a time loop and cycles. And then I found this article - <a rpl="" class="relative pointer-events-auto a cursor-pointer
  
  
  
  
  underline
  " href="https://collider.com/eternal-sunshine-of-the-spotless-mind-original-ending/#:~:text=Eternal%20Sunshine%20of%20the%20Spotless%20Mind%27s%20original%20script%20had%20a,from%20a%20more%20cynical%20perspective" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">https://collider.com/eternal-sunshine-of-the-spotless-mind-original-ending/#:~:text=Eternal%20Sunshine%20of%20the%20Spotless%20Mind%27s%20original%20script%20had%20a,from%20a%20more%20cynical%20perspective</a>.
  </p><p>
    In brief, it says that in the original script, the ending is a scene 50+ years after where Clem erases Joel for the 15th time while Joel leaves her audio messages asking why she's ignoring him.
  </p><p>
    The original ending was changed probably because the director may have wanted to wrap things up on a more positive note
  </p><p>
    And I also remembered there was this commentary on YouTube that people want their relationship to be more like in The Notebook (2004), but in real life, it's more like in Eternal Sunshine.
  </p><p>
    And when I learned about this original script... Well, this is truly a real-life Notebook.
  </p><p>
    I still prefer the script that ended up in the movie though.
