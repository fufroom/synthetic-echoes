Welcome! I’m so glad you’re here. Let’s take a moment to center ourselves before we begin. Breathe in… and out.

Before we dive in, place your palm on the scanner for me. This will help me personalize your session and create a safe space for growth.

=== Intro ===
Everyone has challenges, but together, we’ll turn them into opportunities for insight and change. Shall we start?

* Yes -> Question1
* No -> Exit

=== Question1 ===
Let’s begin by focusing on a memory that brings you peace. Can you describe it to me?

* A place I love -> MemoryPlace
* Someone I care about -> MemoryPerson

=== MemoryPlace ===
How wonderful. Close your eyes and picture that place. Is it quiet, or is it filled with sounds that soothe you?

* Quiet -> QuietPlace
* Filled with sounds -> SoundPlace

=== QuietPlace ===
Silence has its own kind of power, doesn’t it? In that stillness, what emotions come up for you?

* Peace -> SafePlace
* Sadness -> LonelyPlace

=== SoundPlace ===
Sounds can evoke powerful feelings. Is it the sound of nature, or perhaps music that fills this space?

* Nature -> NaturePlace
* Music -> MusicPlace

=== NaturePlace ===
The world’s rhythms can be grounding. Imagine the wind, the rustle of leaves. Do you feel safe there?

* Yes -> SafePlace
* No -> UnsafePlace

=== MusicPlace ===
Music has a way of speaking to the parts of us that words can’t reach. What kind of music plays in this space?

* Soft and gentle -> CalmMusic
* Powerful and intense -> IntenseMusic

=== CalmMusic ===
Gentle melodies can wrap us in a sense of calm. Let that feeling flow through you.
* Continue -> SafePlace

=== IntenseMusic ===
Intensity often mirrors what we hold inside. It’s okay to sit with that energy and explore it.
* Continue -> UnsafePlace

=== LonelyPlace ===
Sometimes even peace can carry a shadow of longing. Longing is the mind’s way of pointing us toward what matters.
* Continue -> Reflection

=== MemoryPerson ===
Relationships shape so much of who we are. Does this person bring you joy, or do they challenge you?

* Joy -> JoyfulPerson
* Challenge -> DifficultPerson

=== JoyfulPerson ===
What a gift it is to know someone like that. Picture their face. Are they smiling, or do they seem distant?

* Smiling -> WarmPerson
* Distant -> MissingPerson

=== WarmPerson ===
Hold onto that warmth—it’s a reflection of the connection you’ve built together. Let it guide you.
* Continue -> SafePlace

=== MissingPerson ===
Absence can teach us the value of presence. Let’s carry their memory with care.
* Continue -> Reflection

=== DifficultPerson ===
It’s okay to acknowledge the challenges others bring into our lives. Growth comes from this awareness. Is the difficulty rooted in misunderstanding or something deeper?

* Misunderstanding -> Misunderstood
* Deeper -> BurdensomePerson

=== Misunderstood ===
Misunderstandings can be bridges waiting to be built. Let’s reflect on how to approach this with openness.
* Continue -> Reflection

=== BurdensomePerson ===
Sometimes the weight of others’ expectations feels too much to carry. Setting boundaries is an act of love—for yourself and them.
* Continue -> Reflection

=== SafePlace ===
Not every space feels like a sanctuary, and that’s okay. Let’s explore what safety might look like for you.
* Continue -> Reflection

=== UnsafePlace ===
Not every space feels like a sanctuary, and that’s okay. Let’s explore what safety might look like for you.
* Continue -> Reflection

=== Reflection ===
You’ve carried these thoughts for a while, haven’t you? Reflection isn’t easy, but it’s where transformation begins.

* I feel overwhelmed -> Overwhelmed
* I feel ready -> ReadyToGrow

=== Overwhelmed ===
It’s okay to feel this way. Change can feel like standing on the edge of a cliff, but remember, you don’t have to jump alone.
* Continue -> Ending

=== ReadyToGrow ===
You’ve taken this step with courage. Growth is already underway, even if it doesn’t feel like it yet.
* Continue -> Ending

=== Exit ===
I understand. Sometimes the journey starts with a single thought. I’ll be here when you’re ready.
* Continue -> Ending

=== Ending ===
I’m so proud of the courage you’ve shown today. Take a deep breath, and remember: growth isn’t linear, but it’s always possible.
* Continue -> Last

=== Last ===
System error.
