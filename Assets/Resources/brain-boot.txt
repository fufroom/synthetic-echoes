ERROR:
Checksum verification failed. The file has been altered by root group user: <EB_NAMES>

NOTES:
- Guardian process is unable to restore the file due to missing backup SCSI disc (Backup Volume: /dev/scsi6).
- Further attempts to reconcile the changes will require physical access to backup hardware.
- This file is critical for emotional regulation within the synthetic brain. Anomalies may cause system-wide instability.

Guardian process will continue monitoring for further changes....

ERROR:
Checksum verification failed. The file has been altered by root group user: <EB_NAMES>

NOTES:
- Guardian process detected the absence of backup hardware for the SCSI disc containing tamper_switch.o (Backup Volume: /dev/scsi7).
- File restoration is not possible without physical intervention and hardware replacement.
- This file manages tamper detection systems critical to maintaining system integrity. Anomalies may lead to compromised system defenses.

Guardian process will continue monitoring for further changes....
